A simple backup/restore tool for Farming Simulator 17/19

How to install:
* Download ![FarmSimBackupManager.zip](https://github.com/wriley/FarmSimBackupManager/raw/master/download/FarmSimBackupManager.zip) and extract to folder of your choice
* Double click FarmSimBackupManager.exe
* Set a backup folder location to store created backup files
* Pick your Farming Simulator version

**Note: If you have saves made with an older version of this tool then you'll need to rename the files. Add "FarmingSimulator2017_" to the beginning. The tool now names saves based on the version of Farming Simulator you choose.**
